# Cheat
A cheatsheet manager

## What is cheat
Cheat is a command written in python to help you manage your cheatsheets. Cheat uses YAML which makes the cheatsheets readble for humans as well as easy to interprate for machines.

## Features
* wildcard topics (You can use wildcards to search for topics)
* tags (You can filter out cheat cards using tags)
* YAML (You can easily read and write cheatsheets, as well as your machine)
* Other Cool Stuff you can maybe contribute here?

## What the hell are these things?

### Cheatsheet
A cheatsheet is a set of cheat cards written in YAML format in a file on your CHEATPATH...  We'll get through all of these in a second.

### Cheat Card
A cheat card is a single cheat or reminder, which includes three parts:
* Author: Something to give credit to the person who created it
* tags: An array of tags to help you filter out your cards
* text: The actual cheat or reminder

### YAML
> YAML: YAML Ain't Markup Language

> YAML is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages.

taken from [The Official YAML Web Site] (http://yaml.org/) Read more there.

We are using YAML 1.1 using PyYaml. You don't need to know YAML, if you want to create cheatsheet just see the cheatsheet on cheat.
### CHEATPATH
CHEATPATH is an optional Enviormental Variable that you can set and point it to locations (yes, plural) of your cheatsheets. If none is provided the default `/usr/share/cheat/` will be used.

If you want to provide one, add something like this to your .bashrc or .zshrc:
```
export CHEATPATH=/place/to/first/loc:/place/to/second/one
```

### wildcard
A Wildcard is a regular expression thingy that is there helping you find stuff. As an example, you may have these sheats:
* cheat1.yaml
* cheat2.yaml
* camel.yaml
* someotherstuff.yaml

Then you can provide these as your caption:
`cheat\*` (yes, you have to escape special characters or your stupid shell will capture them)
* cheat1.yaml
* cheat2.yaml

`cheat`
* cheat1.yaml
* cheat2.yaml
(yes, by default we add * before and after your topic)

`c\*`
* cheat1.yaml
* cheat2.yaml
* camel.yaml


## MANUAL
Okay, enough about stuff. Here is how it all works...

#### Showing cheats
I'm assuming you have added cheat.py to your PATH.

```
cheat.py topic
```
and that's it. 
Although we can use some flags...

### Show Author -a --author
You can use -a or --author to display authors
ex:
```
cheat.py topic -a
```

### Show Tags -T --show_tags
See the list of tags for each card using this parameter.
ex:
```
cheat.py topic -T
```

### Limit results --count -c
You can limit the cards to certain numbers.
ex:
```
cheat.py topic -c 5 #Return only the last 5
```

### Filter based on tags --tag -t
You can filter the cards by providing tags to look for.
ex:
```
cheat.py topic -t file
```
This will bring up any card containing file flag.

You can include more than one flag:
```
cheat.py topic -t file -t tips
```
This will bring any card containing file or tips flag. Note that tags are not wildcardified (if that's a word) and you have to type the exact topic. Maybe in future we can improve this somehow?

### Location --location -l
If you want to use a specefic location instead of CHEATPATH or the default one, you can present it here.
ex:
```
cheat.py topic -l /usr/share/cheats/:~/.config/cheat/
```

### Show --show -s
I really have no idea why I put it here, it's the default behaviour and the only way to disable it (so far) is by calling --add, which we'll cover in the next section.

## Add cards --add 
You can __interactivly__ add a card to your cheatsheets using this flag.
ex:
```
cheat.py --add
```

### Author --author -a
If you pass this, the command will ask you to provide an author.

### Tags --tag -t
Just as before, you have to pass your tags using the original commands. **Tags are not added interactively! You have to pre-define them!**
ex:
```
cheat.py --add -t file -t stuff
```

### Other commands...
the -T or `--show_tags` still works when printing the card at end.
the --count or -c won't throw any error, although is ineffective.
The --location or -l works as before.


## Contributing
Here are a few things you can contribute to at the moment:
* Improve this README.md file, I beg you!
* Check to see if there is any issue you can solve.
* Improve the code in any way, this has been a night's job
* **PLEASE write cheatsheets if you can, we'll appriciate it**
* Introduce (and maybe brag a little?) us to your friends and enemies. We are pretty new and unknown thing.
* A MAKE file would also be very good!
* Add ideas to how one can contribute.

### Ideas for furthur improvement
You know, things. I'll add this later when I'm awake.
