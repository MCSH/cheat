    Okay remember when I said only 2 spaces for indention?
    Well you can use any number you want, as long as it is consistance
    within it's scope. It's a YAML file after all!
      and oh, further indentions are kewl

      and new lines!

    Actually any valid YAML file could pass,
    as long as it has a dictionary containing text and two optional paramaters
    author and tags.
    Of course tags is an array of String and author is a String
